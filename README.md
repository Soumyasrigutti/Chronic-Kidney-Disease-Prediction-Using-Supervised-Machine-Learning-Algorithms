# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction-Using-Supervised-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on medical data. Early detection of CKD is crucial for timely intervention, preventing further complications. The model is trained using various clinical features such as age, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and more.
